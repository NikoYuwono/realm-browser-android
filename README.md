# realm-browser-android

Realm browser that can be used to see tables, structure and content. This browser can be accessed from localhost that hosted by the Android device. To achieve that I'm using NanoHTTPD library.

![sample](realm_browser_sample.png)


## Usage

To use this library you can create an instance of RealmBrowser and then call `RealmBrowser.start();` you can also set the port if you want. Don't forget to call `RealmBrowser.stop();` after you finished.

To access RealmBrowser from your browser your Android device and PC/Mac need to be on the same network. And then you can call `realmBrowser.showServerAddress(this);` to show the address in logcat.

## TODO list

1. Implement advanced search function (Basic search is available)
2. Implement sort function

Any feedbacks, issues or pull requests would be greatly appreciated.
